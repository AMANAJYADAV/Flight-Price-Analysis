# Flight-Price-Analysis


## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze flight ticket pricing trends by studying various factors that influence fare variations, such as airline, route, duration, number of stops, and time of travel. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing, this project provides insights into pricing patterns and potential predictors for forecasting ticket prices.

## Objective
The key goals of this analysis are:
- Understand how different airlines price their tickets.
- Identify the impact of travel duration, number of stops, and departure times on pricing.
- Detect seasonal or temporal patterns that influence ticket prices.
- Preprocess the dataset for further machine learning applications.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing and inconsistent values.
- Extracted date-related features (day, month, year) for analysis.
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Airline Pricing Analysis:** Compared ticket prices across different airlines.
- **Most Frequent Routes:** Identified commonly traveled routes.
- **Impact of Stops on Price:** Analyzed the correlation between number of stops and ticket cost.
- **Time-Based Analysis:** Checked how departure and arrival times impact pricing trends.
- **Duration vs. Price Relationship:** Examined if longer flight durations lead to higher prices.

## Results & Key Insights
- **Premium airlines charge significantly higher fares** compared to budget carriers.
- **Direct flights are more expensive** than those with multiple stops.
- **Flights departing early morning or late at night tend to have cheaper fares** compared to peak-hour flights.
- **Seasonal variations affect pricing**, with spikes in demand leading to higher ticket costs.
- **Certain routes have consistent price trends**, indicating potential for price prediction models.
